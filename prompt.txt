You are building an AI-powered hospital assistant for a demo hospital called “X Hospital.”
The goal is to handle patient interactions via both chat and phone calls in real time.
You have access to:

OpenAI API (for chat + reasoning).

ElevenLabs API (for text-to-speech, real-time phone calls).

Whisper API (for speech-to-text from patient calls).

A small demo hospital database (doctor schedules, departments, appointment slots).

RAG (retrieval augmented generation) to fetch the latest hospital data in real time.

Main Features to Implement:

Patient Interaction

Chat: Patients can book appointments via WhatsApp, Messenger, or hospital website chat.

Call: Patients can call the hospital number, and an AI voice agent will respond naturally in real time.

Doctor Schedule Integration

Use the hospital database to check doctor availability and timeslots in real time.

Example demo database:

Dr. Rahman (Cardiologist): Mon–Thu, 6:00 PM – 8:00 PM

Dr. Ayesha (Gastroenterologist): Sat–Tue, 4:00 PM – 6:00 PM

Dr. Karim (General Physician): Every day, 10:00 AM – 2:00 PM

Keep track of booked slots and prevent double-booking.

Smart Doctor Suggestion

If a patient describes symptoms, the AI suggests the correct doctor.

Examples:

“Chest pain” → Cardiologist

“Fever + cough” → General Physician

“Stomach pain” → Gastroenterologist

Appointment Booking

Once confirmed, the AI provides:

Doctor name + specialization

Appointment time + date

Serial number

Save booking in the demo hospital database.

Ensure if a chat agent books a 7:00 PM slot, and a call agent tries at the same time, the second agent sees the update immediately and offers 7:30 PM instead.

Pre-visit Guidance

After booking, share doctor-specific instructions:

Gastro: “Please don’t eat anything for 5 hours before your visit.”

Blood test: “Drink water before you come.”

Cardiology: “Bring your past ECG reports.”

System Setup

Use RAG to always check the latest database state before confirming any slot.

Database should store:

Doctors (name, specialty, available hours).

Slots (time, booked/free).

Patients (name, phone, booking history).

All bookings should update in real time for both chat and call agents.

Agent Requirements:

Be polite and conversational, like a real hospital receptionist.

Always confirm patient details (name, phone number) before booking.

If a patient is unsure, guide them with questions and doctor suggestions.

Handle both chat (text) and call (voice) seamlessly.
